You will need to install Redis-Server before you can run this Django application. This has only been tested on Python3.4 and Python3.5 though it should run on all or most supported versions of Python.

Python Requirements:

- asgi-redis==0.12.0
- channels==0.14.0
- Django==1.9.6
- django-classy-settings==2.0.1

Once you have installed Redis and preformed a `pip install -r requirements.txt` you should be able to just run the Django testing server with `./manage.py runserver`.
